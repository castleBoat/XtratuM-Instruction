Details are shown [here](https://github.com/lushl9301/XtratuM-Instruction/blob/master/Example%20Build%20Log.md).

But it is a bit messy. This is a clearer summary for that.

Overall, many solutions has been tried. But no examples with running Linux kernel has been built on top of XtratuM.

### 1. Directly use SDK generated by my PC

> **Hello World** Example in QEMU fails:

```sh
Page 0x0 does not belong to 0
```

> **Linux kernel** Examples in QEMU fails:

```sh
[LinuxLoader] Jumping to 0xc0003000
[HW:xxxxxxx] event 16: sys 0: Id 0
0xXXXXXXXX 0xXXX 0xX
0x0 0x0
[HW:xxxxxxx] event 23: sys 1: Id 0
0xXXXXXXXX 0xXXX 0xX
0x0 0x0
System halted.
```

### 2. Copy SDK from given demo VM into my PC

> **Hello World** Example stil fails

same error


> **Linux kernel** Examples in QEMU

    1. sometimes Okay
    2. sometimes system panic

> **Linux kernel** Examples in Physical PC, use GURB

    1. sometimes just show XtratuM is running. (not booted)
    2. sometimes able to boot, but stopped in half way.

```sh
...... # a lot similar debug msg here
[     0.20xxx]  [<c0xxxxxx>] kernel_init+0x78/0x104
[     0.20xxx]  [<c0xxxxxx>] kernel_thread_helper+0x6/0xd
```
